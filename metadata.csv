Eligible participants will have had either an LDL-C \>100 mg/dL or non-HDL-C \>130 mg/dL without a current diagnosis of coronary heart disease and are willing to adhere to a whole food plant based diet for at least 8 weeks.

Throughout the study, patients will have access to dietary counseling which will be provided by a certified nutritionist and will be asked to record and submit daily food diaries. Study participants will be asked to adhere to a whole food plant based diet for a total of 8 weeks. Prior to the final study visit, participants will be asked to obtain follow-up fasting bloodwork around 7 weeks post start of whole food plant based diet.

NCT05866848,Effects of Caffeine on Cerebral Blood Flow,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05866848,COMPLETED,"The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate in clinically healthy young people if:

* after caffeine ingestion, there are variations in blood velocity of the middle cerebral arteries (VMCA),
* this variation is dependent on the administered dose.

Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was used to record blood VMCA in three groups of 15 clinically healthy young adults each - no caffeine, low caffeine (45 mg) and high caffeine group (120 mg). Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography provided simultaneous bilateral VMCA measurements while subjects performed functional tests (hyperventilation and hypoventilation orders) and three cognitive activities (Test 1, short-term remembering, Test 2, solving a vocabulary problem, and Test 3, solving a math problem) each in 31-second tests with 1-minute rest between them.

NCT02791984,Respiratory Variability in Aortic Blood Velocity Measured by Suprasternal View as an Indicator of Fluid Responsiveness,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02791984,COMPLETED,Respiratory changes in aortic blood velocity have been described as an indicator of fluid responsiveness when measured in the left ventricular outflow tract by trans esophageal echography. A threshold value of 12% allowed discrimination between responders and nonresponders with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 89%. The suprasternal window is already used to measure cardiac output. The primary endpoint of this study is to determine the predictive value of the respiratory variability in aortic blood velocity measured by suprasternal view (‚àÜVpicSS) as an indicator of fluid responsiveness. The secondary endpoint is to compare maximum velocity and velocity time integral measured by suprasternal and transthoracic view.,Cardiovascular System,DEVICE: Fluid challenge with 250 ml of Ringer Lactate,"Percentage of cardiac flow variability, Percentage of cardiac flow variability between the 2 echographic measures.

NCT03848572,Repetitive Assessement of PRECISE-DAPT Score,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03848572,COMPLETED,"Patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) require dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). Preliminary assessment of the PRECISE-DAPT score is mandatory in order to assess the risk of bleeding while on DAPT. The score takes into consideration age, creatinine clearance, haemoglobin, white blood- cell count and previous spontaneous bleeding. One should consider, however, that some of the variables included in the PRECISE-DAPT score might change with time. As a consequence, the PRECISE-DAPT score should not be considered a static score as it might vary after the initial computation.

It remains unknown, however, if the use of the delta PRECISE-SCORE, which reflects the change in score between baseline and follow-up, might help to improve the management of PCI patients in order to decrease the bleeding risk during follow-up.",Cardiovascular Diseases|Interventional Cardiology,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Repetitive assessment of PRECISE-DAPT score,"Bleeding episode, The time to first occurrence of clinically relevant bleeding, defined as Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) Types 2, 3 or 5 bleeding, 12 months",University of Roma La Sapienza,N/A,INTERVENTIONAL,2019-12-31,Repetitive Assessement of PRECISE-DAPT Score Cardiovascular Diseases|Interventional Cardiology DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Repetitive assessment of PRECISE-DAPT score
NCT02270242,Ticagrelor With Aspirin or Alone in High-Risk Patients After Coronary Intervention,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02270242,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to compare the use of ticagrelor alone versus ticagrelor and aspirin together. Both ticagrelor and aspirin stop platelets from sticking together and forming a blood clot that could block blood flow to the heart. This study will look to determine the effectiveness and safety of ticagrelor alone, compared to ticagrelor plus aspirin in reducing clinically relevant bleeding and in reducing ischemic adverse events among high-risk patients who have had a percutaneous intervention with at least one drug-eluting stent. A patient is considered high-risk if they meet certain clinical and/or anatomic criteria.

Up to 9000 subjects will be enrolled at the time of their index PCI. Subjects meeting randomization eligibility criteria at 3 months post enrollment will be randomized to either ticagrelor plus aspirin or ticagrelor plus placebo for an additional 12 months.
